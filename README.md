# Introduction
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It is designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.

There are two popular versions of the Python programming language in use today: Python 2 and Python 3. The Python community has decided to move on from Python 2 to Python 3, and many popular libraries have announced that they will no longer support Python 2.

Since Python 3 is the future, in this tutorial extensively we will be using it exclusively.
